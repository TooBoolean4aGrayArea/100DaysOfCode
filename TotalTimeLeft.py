#Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old. 

#It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

#> You have x days, y weeks, and z months left. 

#Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers. 

 

#**Warning** your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.
